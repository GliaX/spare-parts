# Spare parts repository
This repository is meant for the creation and maintenance of 3D printable spare parts for medical devices, especially those used in the Gaza strip where parts are not readily available to purchase or import.

All files are made in FreeCAD and licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware License v1.0.


A special note about these parts: These parts are for use by biomedical engineering professionals. It is highly likely that if you are not a professional, you will fuck this up and hurt people. If you are a well-intentioned amateur operating in an under-developed medical system, you are the most likely to hurt people who may not understand the risks.

Please do not hesitate to contact us and ask for help in ensuring your project is a success.

Thank you,

The Glia team
